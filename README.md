# learn-taichi
Playing around with the [Taichi](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi) language.


## Learning Objectives
- How does Taichi work? 
- Learn about differentiable programming
- Can we render Taichi simulations in the broweser? WASM or plain JS?
- What can be done at compile time vs runtime?
- Sparse matrix representation and performance
- How does the MPM work? Can I write some basic simulation programs i.e. basic thermal sim, some simple elastic mechanical sim.
- What is the best way to serialize state, so we can replay without re-compute? Can we combine this serialization with some form of compression (spatial and temporal).
- I'm sure I'll think of more.
